									<h2>Tools and Toys for Knowledge Construction</h2>
									<p>MSTU 5199</p>
								</header>
								<p>This course is a hands-on design course intended to introduce students to the core tenants and techniques of constructionist design. In this course students explore, use, and evaluate existing educational technologies specifically designed to engage learners in personally meaningful construction. These technologies include virtual construction environments and tools (NetLogo, Scratch, Pencil Code, etc) for creating digital games, simulations, or interactive stories as well as state-of-the-art prototyping equipment (3D printers, laser cutters, microcontrollers, etc) for developing wearables, robotics, interactive exhibits, and electronic toys. While a portion of this course is devoted to becoming familiar with the affordances of these technological tools the primary goal is for students to design and develop a new tool or environment for knowledge construction.</p>
								<p>On this website you can find summaries and images of a few of the final projects produced by students in the course.</p>

											<h4>E. T.</h4>
											<p>My overall goal is to create a constructionist toy for young children to cultivate empathy. This toy will help students identify emotions by observing the behaviors of the toy while interacting with it. In addition, students will be able to express their own emotions through programing the behaviors of the toy. This toy will be ideally used in classroom and afterschool settings with teachers’ facilitation, because teachers can initiate discussions around the toy to help students be more observant of other people’s behaviors and be more explicit of their own feelings.<br><em>--Fang Yi</em></p>

											<h4>Embodied Number Sense Kit</h4>
											<p>I am designing a constructionist kit that allows for the creation of embodied number models. The embodied number sense kit is a mixed bag of simplified, easily connectable “blocks” that students can use to construct number sense models. The units are powered by a simple battery with safely designed outputs to power a mixture of components. Several of the components available to young students are LEDs, dials, simple switches, sound-emitting devices, and motors. Once the units are connected, the student can switch on a low level current, which will then power their self-created device.<br><em>--Kevin Alster</em></p>

											<h4>Konesans Blocks</h4>
											<p>Konesans blocks is a toy composed of a series of wooden blocks. The math manipulative is a re-imagined take on classic blocks with a fun math twist. Elegant, simple, and innovative, konesans blocks introduces basic math concepts such as number sense, numeracy, basic arithmetic, and multiplication.<br><em>--Jacques Louis</em></p>

											<h4>GoGo Board Toolkit</h4>
											<p>The GoGo Board toolkit is a hardware-embedded curriculum designed to teach children aged 7-10 years old the concept of compassion through invention. The toolkit is inspired by stories that adults read out loud to their loved ones. Many storybooks are interactive but few engender proactive behavior from young readers. Storybooks in the GoGo Board toolkit aims to help young children observe and understand the problems of others. With support from adults, children can construct original inventions that help others solve their problems using the GoGo Board, scrap or prototype materials, and their imagination. The main objective is to inspire children to be active social inventors who can see the problems of others or themselves and be eager to solve them.<br><em>--Sawaros Thanapornsangsuth</em></p>

											<h4>Flipper's Stamp Collection</h4>
											<p>"Flipper's Stamp Collection" is a prototype for a series of curriculum worksheets, and a workspace for planning a film with coin tossed randomized segments and pathways. It is intended to be an informal philosophical art curriculum for adults to share with adults or adults to share with teenagers and children.<br><em>--Rory Parks</em></p>
